[Easy] Calculate Distance
Topics: I/O, driver, main loop, while loops

Write a program that: (Calculate Distance) [I/O, driver, main loop, while loops] 
  -Prompts the user for two points in the form (x, y). 
  -Computes and displays the distance between these two points to the terminal. 
  -The program should prompt the user if they want to calculate another distance. 
  -If the user says yes, repeat the program.
  -If the user says no, exit the program. 
  
Example I/O:
  Input: [“0, 3”, “4, 0”, “no”] output: 5.0
